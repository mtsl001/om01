Local vector storage eliminates network latency and supports the **intelligent context summarization** requirement while providing semantic search capabilities essential for the **dependency-aware code generation** feature.

**AI Integration: OpenRouter API with Claude Sonnet 4**
**Justification:** Directly implements the **Claude Sonnet 4 Integration with Extended Thinking** P0 feature. OpenRouter provides reliable access while extended thinking mode enables the complex architectural decisions required by the **multi-phase development orchestrator**. API-based integration mitigates the **AI dependency risk** through provider abstraction.

**Local Services: Node.js with TypeScript**
**Justification:** Supports the **development velocity KPI** (70-90% reduction) through rapid service development. Node.js enables seamless integration with VS Code extension APIs while TypeScript ensures code quality consistency (>95% architectural consistency KPI). Local execution aligns with **personal use** and **no cloud processing** requirements.

**State Management: SQLite with File System Integration**
**Justification:** Perfect for **personal use** requirement with zero setup complexity. SQLite provides ACID compliance for project state management while file system integration enables direct workspace manipulation required by the **VS Code integration** feature. Supports the **project continuity** problem solution.

## **8. Architectural Plan for Scalability and KPIs**

**Development Velocity KPI (70-90% reduction in time-to-working-application):**
**Potential Bottleneck:** AI generation latency and context preparation time
**Architectural Strategy:** 
- Implement **intelligent context caching** to pre-load relevant context for anticipated next steps
- **Parallel phase preparation** where subsequent phases are analyzed and prepared while current phase executes
- **Incremental context building** to avoid regenerating entire context packages for each generation request

**Code Quality Consistency KPI (>95% architectural consistency score):**
**Potential Bottleneck:** Context drift across large projects leading to inconsistent patterns
**Architectural Strategy:**
- **Pattern enforcement engine** that validates generated code against established project patterns
- **Architectural constraint propagation** ensuring design decisions from early phases are maintained throughout
- **Automated consistency checking** integrated into the quality gates with correction loops

**Context Management Efficiency KPI (500+ files, <3 second context retrieval):**
**Potential Bottleneck:** Vector search performance and context graph traversal in large projects
**Architectural Strategy:**
- **Hierarchical context indexing** with pre-computed relevance scores at different granularity levels
- **Context query optimization** using dependency graph pruning to eliminate irrelevant paths
- **Incremental vector updates** instead of full re-indexing when files change
- **Context compression algorithms** that maintain semantic meaning while reducing token count

**User Productivity KPI (<30 second setup time for resuming work):**
**Potential Bottleneck:** Project state reconstruction and context warming
**Architectural Strategy:**
- **Persistent context graphs** that maintain semantic relationships between sessions
- **Project state snapshots** enabling instant restoration of multi-phase progress
- **Background context maintenance** that updates context indices when VS Code is idle
- **Predictive context loading** based on recently accessed files and typical workflow patterns

This architecture ensures ReadyAI can scale from simple scripts to enterprise-grade applications while maintaining the responsiveness and quality standards required by the Solo Developer Sam persona, with each technical decision directly supporting the charter's defined goals and KPIs.
