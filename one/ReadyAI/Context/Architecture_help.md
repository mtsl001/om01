You're absolutely right to question this! There's a **contradiction between your personal preferences and the ReadyAI project specifications**.

## **Your Personal Preference vs ReadyAI Architecture**

### **Your Background (From Our Previous Conversations)**
- You develop backend services with **Python and FastAPI**
- You use SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow for database management
- You organize backend code with Python for logging
- You use Python web frameworks for static files

### **ReadyAI Project Specifications (From Attached Documents)**
Looking at the ReadyAI project documents, the architecture is defined as:

**Backend Framework**: **Node.js + TypeScript + Express.js**
- From the Project Scaffolding Boilerplate: "Node.js backend with TypeScript"
- Backend package.json shows Express.js dependencies
- Database operations use `better-sqlite3` (Node.js SQLite driver)
- All migration files are `.ts` (TypeScript) files

## **The Architectural Decision**

ReadyAI uses **Node.js/Express.js** instead of FastAPI because:

1. **VS Code Extension Integration**: Seamless integration with VS Code's TypeScript-based extension API
2. **Unified Language Stack**: TypeScript across backend, frontend, and VS Code extension
3. **Local-First Architecture**: Node.js better suits the desktop/local deployment model
4. **Development Velocity**: Single language reduces context switching

## **What This Means for Implementation**

For the **ReadyAI project**, you'll be implementing:
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript (not FastAPI)
- **Database**: better-sqlite3 with custom TypeScript migrations (not Alembic)
- **Migration System**: Custom Node.js migration scripts (not Python-based)
